    "# Advanced Modeling for MPG Forecasting\n",
    "After establishing a baseline model using simple linear regression, it's essential to explore more advanced modeling techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and account for complex patterns in the data. While baseline models offer a solid starting point, they often rely on strong assumptions—such as linear relationships and absence of multicollinearity—which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world data like fuel efficiency (MPG).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we introduce a series of increasingly sophisticated models including\n",
    "1. Linear Regression\n",
    "2. Ridge Regression\n",
    "3. Random Forest\n",
    "4. Gradient Boosting\n",
    "5. XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are capable of handling non-linear relationships, interactions between variables, and high-dimensional feature spaces. Regularization techniques like Ridge Regression help mitigate overfitting, while ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting combine the strengths of multiple learners to improve generalization. XGBoost, a highly optimized gradient boosting algorithm, often delivers state-of-the-art performance in structured data problems like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the performance of these models against the baseline, we aim to identify the most reliable and interpretable approach for accurately forecasting miles per gallon, ultimately supporting more informed decisions in vehicle design and policy planning."
